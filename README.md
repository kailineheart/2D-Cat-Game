# 2D-Cat-Game
first 2D game

This is a game about a block cat climbing trees in space

There are three difficulty levels to pick from normal, hard, and super of which you have to beat the levels in order or at least that's the plan. If you get a score above a certain point instead of the normal three random fish you'll get the ellusive unicorn fish to appear at the top.

It is intended to be a vertically scrolling platoform game that will eventually be converted into an android app.
